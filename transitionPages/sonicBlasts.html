        <h1>Seismic Air Gun</h1>
        <p>
          Offshore oil and gas exploration uses deafening seismic surveys that
          generate the loudest human sounds in the ocean, short of those made by
          explosives. Seismic testing involves blasting the seafloor with
          high-powered airguns (a kind of powerful horn) every 10 seconds and
          measuring the echoes with long tubes to map offshore oil and gas
          reserves. These blasts disturb, injure and kill marine wildlife around
          the clock for years on end.
        </p>

        <p>Help Roxzie scare away the seismic survey ships to stop them from blasting their air guns into the ocean!</p>

        <p>Use the WASD keys to move and space bar to shoot sonic screams back at the ships!</p>
